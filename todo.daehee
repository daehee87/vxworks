1. turns out target binary (ocr1100ctrl) is compatible to ordinary ELF32 object file.
2. link the target binary with wrapper (gcc -o wrap ocr1100ctrl wrap.c -m32)
3. there are lot of external symbols -> make fake functions. infer function types from IDA.
4. target binary is based on C++. we need to compile the wrapper via g++, so put extern "C" to C functions.
5. make fake C++ functions by providing namespace and Class -> done.
6. C++ initialization (libc_start_main) failes due to lack of C++ implementation code
7. to circumvent this, we hook libc_start_main via LD_PRELOAD and write our fuzzer stub there.
8. connect our fuzzer stub and AFL++
